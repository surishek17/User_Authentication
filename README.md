Hi, My name is Shekhar from Una, Himachal Pradesh.

# Getting Started with Node User Authentication App

Firstly, In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` to install the" package-lock.json" file and "node modules".

Now, JWT secret key store is in Environment file ".env" file.

And the Mysql database details in the "app.js" file.

## `node app.js` command run the server on the port 3000 and connected to the database.

In the Mysql database name "Node" and table name "users" where user information store users "id", "username" and "password".

## Run the app using `http://localhost:3000/` When you click the Register button then Popup shows `User registered successfully` and When you click Login button then Popup shows `Login successful` then page redirects to the `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` which shows the `Welcome to the Dashboard` with `Logout` button.



# Write a brief explanation of your approach, any challenges faced, and how you ensured security in your implementation.

In this project, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js with Express, and MySQL to create a user authentication system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Here's an overview of my approach, challenges faced, and security measures implemented:

# Approach:
`Frontend`: I created HTML pages (index.html and dashboard.html) for user interface elements and forms for user registration and login. I styled the pages using CSS (style.css) to enhance the visual appearance.
`Backend`: I used Node.js with Express to set up the server-side logic. This included defining routes for user registration, login, protected dashboard access, and logout. I utilized MySQL as the database to store user information securely.
`Authentication`: I implemented JWT-based authentication for user login. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued to the client, which is then used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected routes.
`Security`: I ensured secure password storage by hashing passwords using bcrypt before storing them in the database. Additionally, I used HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server to prevent data interception.
# Challenges Faced:
`JWT Implementation`: Implementing JWT authentication required careful consideration of token generation, verification, and expiration. Ensuring that tokens are securely generated and verified without exposing sensitive information posed a challenge.
`Database Integration`: Integrating MySQL with Node.js and handling database queries asynchronously required attention to error handling and ensuring proper connection management.
# Security Measures:
`Password Hashing`: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain secure.
`JWT`: JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication, providing a stateless mechanism for user sessions. Tokens are signed using a secure secret key and include expiration timestamps to mitigate the risk of token misuse or replay attacks.
`HTTPS`: Secure communication between the client and server is enforced using HTTPS, encrypting data in transit and preventing unauthorized access or tampering.

Overall, my approach focused on creating a secure and robust user authentication system by leveraging industry best practices, such as password hashing, JWT authentication, and secure communication protocols. Despite challenges, careful implementation and adherence to security principles ensured a reliable and secure authentication mechanism.
